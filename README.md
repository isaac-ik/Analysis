FOOTBALL TEAMS PERFORMANCE ANALYSTICS
Author: Isaac Ikhaiduwor

In this project, I developed a Performance Dashboard using Python, and other libaries to help teams, leagues, media organizations, betting operators make optimal decisions based on the performance of teams in the Premier league

Possible Analysis
1. Team Performance Analysis: - Compared and visualized the number of wins, draws, and losses for each team.

2. Goal Analysis: - Analyzed the distribution of goals scored and conceded in different time intervals. - Compared the number of clean sheets (matches without conceding goals) for each team.

3. Streak Analysis: - Identified and analyzed the longest winning, drawing, and losing streaks for each team. - Compared the biggest wins and losses at home and away for each team.

4. Discipline Analysis: - Visualized the distribution of yellow and red cards received by each team in different time intervals.

5. Comparison between Teams: - Used bar charts to compare different statistics (e.g., goals scored, clean sheets, cards received) for multiple teams. - Created a dashboard using streamlit to visualize various aspects of team performance side by side for easy comparison
